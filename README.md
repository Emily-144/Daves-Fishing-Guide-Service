# Daves-Fishing-Guide-Service &#127907;
### My first major web development project from when I was in high school! It's an old project but I wanted to include it because seeing progress is cool!

**Assignment:**  
Create a website for a client  

I built this website in 2020 for a client. The client asked for a basic fishing guide service website, and I worked with him to achieve the project's needs. *(Note that for the purposes of this assignment, the contact information is innacurate. Also, my instructor preferred that CSS was included in the HTML files rather than in a separate file)*  

**Languages/Resources Used:**  
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Notepad
4. [Logo Maker](https://www.logomaker.com) for creating the logo
